		<li>Tweet the message onto clients' profiles.</li>
		<li>Log successful and failed tweets.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<h2>Notes</h2>
	<p>1) The Tweet Quote library requires a Twitter Developer account and needs a consumer key, consumer secret and permission level of "Read, write, and direct messages".</p>
	<p>2) Clients that did not give the app authorization to be used, should go to <strong>signup.php</strong> and allow the app access to their accounts. Once the user gives the app permission 
	to access their account, Twitter will redirect the user to <strong>callback.php</strong>. If you would like to change where the callback url is, then you can do this within your <strong>signup.php</strong>:<br /></p>
	<p style='margin-left:24px;'><code>
		&lt;?php<br />
		$Instance = new TweetQuote();<br />
		$Instance-&gt;setCallbackUrl("http://yourwebsite.com/somecallbackurl");<br />
		$Instance-&gt;authorizeApp();<br />
		?&gt;
	</code>
	</p>
	<p>3) <strong>callback.php</strong> expects to receive a response from Twitter with an OAuth Verification. With the OAuth Verification, the app can store the user's credentials and will have direct access to the
	user's account information.</p>
	<p>4) <strong>index.php</strong> is set to recieve the message that should be posted on each stored Twitter account</p>
	<p>Each page (index.php, callback.php, signup.php) are not a requirement for the library to work, however, they show how each different page interacts with the same library</p>
